# Pravoloxinone #

This is a mod for Stardew Valley to introduce the mentioned Pravoloxinone item.

We've all seen the sign in Harvey's clinic, but what exactly is pravoloxinone? Why would you want to drink it?

With this mod, Pravoloxinone is finally a reality and slightly more dangerous than advertised! Harvey will send you the recipe for this mysterious medicine and start selling it in the clinic for 2000g after you've seen his 4 heart event.

### And why drink it? ###
Because it's fun!

### ...Seriously, why should I drink it? ###

Pravoloxinone may give the following effects (with the chance in brackets):
- (20%) Inflict a random debuff for 60 seconds, these will stack.
- (65%) Add a random skills buff of varying level for 10 minutes, these won't stack.
- (10%) Inflict damage between 10 and up to half your health. This won't kill you but can bring you down to 1HP.
- (5%) Dissolve all your bones! Harvey has something to say about this!

May the odds be in your favour!

### And the recipe? ###
To make it you will need
- 1 Energy Tonic
- 1 Muscle Remedy
- 1 Mayonnaise

If you do die due to drinking Pravoloxinone, the death cutscene will be slightly different.
